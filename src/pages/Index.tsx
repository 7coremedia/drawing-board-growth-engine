That means one thing above all else: Customers. You can survive poor branding. You can survive bad ads. You might even survive a bad month. But the moment you run out of customers â€” it's game over. Rule #1 of Business: Don't go out of business. And yet every day, thousands of businesses shut their doors. Not because they're not talented. Not because they're not good at what they do. But because they couldn't get customers. You don't have to be one of them." />
